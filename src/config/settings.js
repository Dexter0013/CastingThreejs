/**
 * settings.js — the single source of truth for every tweakable value in the sandbox.
 *
 * Nothing in the renderer owns state that lives here: shaders, particle systems,
 * lights and post processing all *read* these objects every frame. That is what
 * makes the real-time editor work without rebuilding anything — mutating a field
 * is immediately visible on screen, including on an ice field that is already
 * standing, and including while the clock is paused (`P`), which is when the
 * shapes are actually worth tuning.
 *
 * The one rule that keeps that promise: a system may only ever *sample* these
 * values. It must never copy one into a record at spawn time and read it back
 * later — see `IceAbility`, whose spike records hold nothing but unitless dice
 * rolls, and resolve every metre, radian and second against this file each frame.
 *
 * Conventions
 *  - Colours are stored as `#rrggbb` strings so lil-gui can bind them directly.
 *    Use `utils/color.js#getColor()` to read them as a cached THREE.Color.
 *  - `global` holds multipliers that scale everything at once (1 = neutral).
 *  - The `ice` block holds absolute values.
