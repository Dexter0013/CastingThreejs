# Elemental Sandbox

A linear-skillshot VFX sandbox built with **Three.js**, **Vite** and hand-written **GLSL**.

Four abilities, all cast the same way: press the key to arm, a League-of-Legends style arrow
appears on the ground and swings with the mouse, click to fire.

**Q — Frost Lance.** A fracture front races out along the line while a field of ice crystals
tears up out of the floor behind it — small and dense at your feet, opening into a wall of blades
at the far end, with a cluster thrown up around the impact point.

**E — Storm Lance.** A bolt leaves the caster's hand and a bundle of lightning filaments is drawn
out behind the strike front, holds while it gutters and re-strikes, then blows out. Sparks come
off it the whole way, the floor underneath takes a branching electric burn and a dark scorch, and
the far end gets a shell of ionised air.

**R — Cinder Fall.** A burning rock is lobbed downrange on an arc, trailing a raymarched wake of
burning gas and heating up the whole way: the lava seams splitting its surface prise wider and
brighter as it comes in. It detonates on arrival, throws its own shattered chunks across the floor, and tears the
ground open into a network of molten cracks that keep glowing while the crater burns out.

**F — Nova Beam.** The caster winds a ball of light up in both hands, pulling motes in out of the
air, then lets a column of it out along the line — white-hot core, cyan sheath, gold ribbons
spiralling around it and shock discs racing down it. It *holds* there, burning into the floor and
throwing spray back up the beam, before collapsing to a thread and blinking out. The only cast in
the sandbox that is still happening a second after it landed.

Everything you can see is generated. There are no textures, no sprite sheets and no meshes on
disk except the character: the crystals are procedural geometry, the bolt is a strip of ribbon
placed entirely by a vertex shader, the meteor is an icosphere cratered and sliced by fracture
planes on the CPU, the beam is a parametric tube drawn three times at three radii, the arrow, the
rime, the burns and the molten cracks are signed-distance and noise shaders, and the mist, sparks,
chips and glitter are GPU particles.

**Every parameter is a live slider** — 724 of them — and they stay live while the simulation is
paused. That is the point of the project: freeze a frame mid-eruption, mid-strike or mid-burn with
**P**, then reshape the silhouette, the palette and the timing against a still image.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL Vite prints (default <http://127.0.0.1:5173>).

```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Assets

Two binary assets are served from `public/` and loaded automatically at boot:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `public/models/Standing Idle.fbx` | Rigged character **and** its idle animation clip |
| `public/hdri/spruit_sunrise.hdr` | HDR probe used for image-based lighting and crystal reflections |

The FBX is a Mixamo export: it contains a skinned mesh plus a single animation stack, so the
character and the idle clip come from the same file. Its texture paths are absolute local paths
baked in by the exporting tool and cannot resolve over HTTP, so a hand-authored atlas
(`public/angtexture.png`) is substituted wholesale.

The HDR is loaded as image-based lighting and as the reflection source for the ice — it is never
shown as a visible sky. The stage keeps its flat dark backdrop.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Q** (or **1**) | Arm Frost Lance — press again to put it away |
| **E** (or **2**) | Arm Storm Lance — press again to put it away |
| **R** (or **3**) | Arm Cinder Fall — press again to put it away |
| **F** (or **4**) | Arm Nova Beam — press again to put it away |
| **Move the mouse** | Swing the aim arrow |
| **Left click** | Cast along the arrow |
| **Esc** / **right click** | Cancel an armed cast |
| **Right mouse + drag** | Orbit the camera |
| **Scroll** | Zoom |
| **G** | Show/hide the VFX editor |
| **P** | Pause / resume — *the editor keeps applying* |
| **C** | Clear all active effects |
| **T** | Toggle the character between the standing idle and the meditation sit |
| **H** | Hide the controls panel |

`range` and `minRange` are per ability, so the arrow's reach changes with the slot you have
selected. Aiming closer than the selected ability's `minRange` tints the arrow red and refuses the
cast; set `minRange` to 0 if you would rather cast at your own feet. Cooldowns are per ability
too, so spending one slot never locks the other out.

## How it fits together

### Settings are the API

`src/config/settings.js` holds every tweakable value. Nothing else owns that state: shaders,
particle systems, lights and post passes *read* those objects every frame. That is what makes the
editor work with no rebuild — moving a slider changes the ice field that is already standing, the
next cast, the environment and the post stack at once. Preset loading deep-merges *into* the same
objects so every live binding stays valid.

```js
import { settings } from './config/settings.js';
settings.ice.height = 7;          // visible on the next frame, even mid-cast
settings.thunder.jitter = 1.2;    // re-kinks a bolt that is already in the air
settings.global.timeScale = 0.1;  // slow the whole cast to a crawl
```

Ability blocks are keyed by their id in `ELEMENTS`, and the shared systems that need to know
"which ability is the player holding" — the aim controller, the cooldowns, the HUD — look it up as
`settings[element]`. The four fields they rely on being present are `range`, `minRange`, `speed`
and `cooldown`. Everything else in a block is that ability's own business.

### The rule that makes "edit while paused" work

A spike record in `IceAbility` stores **only what the dice decided**: a position *fraction* along
the line, a signed lateral *fraction*, and a handful of unitless jitters. Not one metre, radian or
second is captured when the cast starts. Every dimension is resolved against `settings.ice` inside
the update loop, which runs on a zero-length frame too.

So dragging `height` re-grows a field that is already standing; dragging `lean` re-tilts it;
dragging `clumping` re-packs it toward the centre line. The only values a record *does* capture
are timestamps — the moment its own eruption was triggered. Those are events, not dimensions.

The four *shape* controls (`facets`, `taper`, `roughness`, `bend`) cannot be expressed as a
per-instance transform, so they are baked into the geometry instead — and a six-sided crystal is
just 60 triangles, cheap enough to regenerate outright rather than approximate in a vertex shader.
`IceAbility#_syncGeometry` hashes those four values and rebuilds the three crystal meshes when the
hash changes, which is what keeps them live sliders rather than restart-required constants.

### Aiming

`AimController` raycasts the pointer onto the ground plane **every frame**, not only on mouse
move, so orbiting the camera with a cast armed swings the arrow under a stationary cursor. It
clamps the distance into `[ice.minRange, ice.range]`, tracks a 0..1 reveal envelope, and emits a
single `cast` event carrying an origin, a unit direction and a distance — which is exactly the
signature `Ability#spawn` takes. It decides nothing about what the cast does.

It runs on **real** time rather than the scaled simulation delta, so the indicator keeps animating
while the sandbox is paused.

### The arrow is one SDF

`AimIndicator` is a single ground quad. Its fragment shader remaps UV into **metres measured from
the caster**, so every control in `settings.aim` is a real measurement — the shaft stays 0.42 m
wide whether the cast is 3 m or 15 m long.

The silhouette is a rounded union of a box (the shaft) and iq's exact triangle SDF (the head);
the cheap half-plane intersection leaves visible corner artefacts on a wedge this shallow. From
that one distance field the shader derives the outline, the rim-weighted interior wash, the
chevrons (a phase skewed by `|x|`, which turns flat bands into arrowheads pointing the way the
cast does), the frost noise and voronoi plates, the ring at the caster's feet, the range cap arc,
a six-fold frost rosette pinned to the impact point, and the sweep-out when the ability is armed.

### The ice

`materials/IceMaterial.js` patches a `MeshStandardMaterial` rather than replacing it, so the
crystals cast and receive the stage's real shadows and pick up the HDR probe. The stylisation is
injected on top:

- **Thickness tint** — a facet seen head-on has the longest path through the crystal, so it
  darkens toward `colorDeep`; grazing edges stay pale. This is the term that makes the field read
  as a solid you can see *into* rather than as blue plastic.
- **Internal fracture** — ridged noise sampled in **world** space, so the crack planes stay a fixed
  physical size whether a spike is ankle-high or three metres tall, and neighbouring crystals look
  quarried from the same block.
- **Feather frost and rime** — fbm sampled in **local** space (0..1 up the crystal), so the milky
  veining and the frost creeping up from the base follow each spike's own axis however it is
  scaled or leaned.
- **Glint** — a hard-thresholded high-frequency field scrolling in world space, biased toward
  grazing angles, which is where real ice catches.
- **Birth flash** — a per-instance attribute the ability drives from 1 to 0 over `birthFade`, so a
  crystal is lit from within for the moment it erupts.

Three `InstancedMesh`es share one material. Three rather than one because the *facets* differ, not
just the proportions — per-instance scaling alone cannot buy that silhouette variety, and three
draw calls is a cheap price.

### The lightning

`ThunderAbility` takes the "no dimensions on the CPU" rule further than the ice does: there is no
path object at all. The bolt is one `InstancedBufferGeometry` — a flat ladder of quads in
*parameter* space, where each vertex carries only `(t, side)`: how far along the bolt it is, and
which edge of the ribbon it is on. One instance is one filament. `materials/LightningMaterial.js`
turns that pair into a world position every frame, so a single strip serves a bolt of any length,
any shape and any width.

Three things stack to make the shape:

- **the axis** — a straight line from the hand to the impact point, bowed by `sag`. The only part
  that knows where the cast is pointing.
- **the fan** — a constant per-filament offset in the plane perpendicular to the axis, opening
  from `spreadNear` at the hand to `spread` at the target and rolling around the axis with
  `twist`. This is what separates one filament from the next.
- **the kinks** — octaves of *linearly* interpolated value noise. Linear on purpose: smoothstep
  would round the corners off, and the corners are the entire reason it reads as lightning rather
  than as a wobbly tube.

The ribbon is turned to face the camera by crossing the local tangent with the view vector, which
is why the bolt keeps its apparent thickness from any angle without ever being a screen-space
line. It is drawn twice — a wide soft halo underneath and the hot core on top — because drawing
the glow as real ribbon rather than leaving it to bloom is what keeps it *attached* to every kink.

Two clocks run the flicker. `restrike` snaps every filament onto a new shape N times a second,
and `crawl` slides the kinks continuously in between; together they stop a held bolt from looking
like a static ribbon. A cast captures exactly one number — a seed, so two casts do not draw the
identical bolt — and resolves every metre, radian and second against `settings.thunder` each
frame. That is why dragging `jitter` re-kinks a bolt that is already in the air.

The ground burns are worth a note as a thing *not* to do. The first version sampled the filament
field on `atan(y, x)`, which hands every radius along a given bearing the same value and draws
dead-straight spokes out of the centre — a firework, not a burn. Sampling the same noise in the
plane and warping the lookup is what lets the filaments meander and fork.

### The beam

The Nova Beam shares the bolt's rule — no dimensions on the CPU — and reaches the opposite look
with it. Where the bolt's whole charm is that its noise is *piecewise-linear* and keeps its
corners, every noise term in the beam is smooth, stretched hard along the flow and crawling
downrange. A beam that kinks is a bolt.

It is a real tube rather than a camera-facing ribbon, because a column this thick has to *have* a
cross-section: the silhouette must bow correctly when you orbit it, the far wall must add through
the near one, and the shock discs have to hug it. `createBeamTubeGeometry` is the ribbon strip one
dimension richer — every vertex carries `(t, a)`, how far along the barrel it is and how far around
— and `materials/BeamMaterial.js` turns that pair into a world position each frame.

That one tube is drawn three times, and the trick is in how the three are weighted:

- **halo** — widest, nothing but a rim term. The atmosphere the beam is shoving out of the way.
- **sheath** — rim-weighted, so it reads as *hollow* and its silhouette edges are its brightest part.
- **core** — narrow, and weighted the **opposite** way: brightest where the view ray runs down the
  barrel and its path through the tube is longest.

Rim-weighted outside, axis-weighted inside, both faces adding: that is a volume integral, cheaply,
and the inversion is the entire reason the middle reads as a solid rod of light instead of as a lit
pipe. Widen `coreWidth` or push `coreFill` up and the three layers collapse into one white tube —
the cyan sheath and the gold coils are only legible because the core leaves them room.

Two more instanced passes put structure on it. The **coils** are the bolt's ribbon strip bent into a
helix, camera-facing and warm on purpose — the colour split is what stops them dissolving into the
sheath. The **shock discs** are an instanced annulus whose phase is `fract(index / count + time ×
speed)`, so the train is a pure function of the clock and there is no queue on the CPU. Both place
themselves against the same `beamRadius()` the tube uses, which is why all five stay welded together
when the profile is dragged.

The beam is also the one ability with a **fourth beat**. The other three run travel → impact →
fade; this one puts a wind-up in front of that, and it needed nothing from the base class:
`advance()` simply refuses to let the front leave the hand until the orb is up to power, so `IMPACT`
becomes the burn and the phase machine is untouched. The far end therefore has an impact that keeps
happening — spray thrown back up the line, pressure shells shed off the burning point, dust and
shockwave rings pushed across the floor, all rate-throttled through the same fractional-rate emitter
the particles use so every rate is a live slider.

### Adding another ability

1. Add a settings block in `config/settings.js` and an entry in `ELEMENTS` / `ELEMENT_META`.
2. Subclass `Ability` and implement `createShaders`, `createParticles`, `onTravel`, `onImpact`,
   `onFade`.
3. Register the class in `abilities/AbilityManager.js`.
4. Add an editor folder in `ui/Editor.js`, and a sigil in `ui/glyphs.js`.
5. Bind a key in `input/InputManager.js` — it emits `ability` with the 0-based slot index, which
   `App` maps through `ELEMENTS`.

Everything else — pooling, the travelling front, the local frame, lights, phases, per-ability
cooldowns, the aim reach and camera framing — is inherited or driven off `ELEMENTS`. The HUD
builds its slots from that array, so a new ability appears in the bar on its own.

### Particles

`particles/ParticleSystem.js` is a GPU-simulated, instanced-quad system. Motion (velocity, gravity,
analytic drag, curl turbulence, vortex swirl), size-over-lifetime, the colour gradient and alpha
fade are all evaluated in the shader from per-instance attributes; the CPU only ever writes spawn
data, and only the slots that changed are uploaded. Particles live in a ring buffer, so spamming
the ability recycles slots instead of allocating. Silhouettes (soft, smoke, streak, leaf, chip,
ring) are procedural — there are no sprite textures anywhere in the project.

Frost Lance uses three systems: **mist** (non-additive, so the fog genuinely occludes and gives the
field depth), **shards** (lit chips under gravity) and **glitter** (additive, negative gravity — the
rising plume that is the signature of the reference frame).

Storm Lance uses four: **sparks** (velocity-stretched streaks under gravity), **motes** (the slow
ionised drift around the bolt), **smoke** (non-additive haze off the scorched floor) and **debris**
(lit chips). Its sparks are emitted from several points along the bolt each frame rather than one:
a beam sheds along its whole length, and a single origin makes every batch read as a starburst.

Nova Beam uses four as well, and works one of them twice: its **motes** are the intake spiralling
*into* the orb while it charges and the drift shed off the column once it is firing — the same glow,
thrown the other way. Its **sparks** are thrown radially off the barrel and then dragged downrange
by `sparkForward`, which is the read that says "pressure"; the bolt's fall instead, and that one
difference does a lot of the work of keeping the two abilities apart.

### Render pipeline

Per frame:

1. **Depth prepass** — the opaque world into a half-res packed-depth buffer. Every VFX shader
   samples it for soft intersections, so nothing cuts a hard line into the ground. The crystals sit
   on `LAYER.WORLD`, so mist and glitter fade softly against them.
2. **Distortion pass** — meshes on the distortion layer write screen-space UV offsets into a second
   half-res buffer. Nothing writes to it in the current build; the pass is kept because it is the
   hook a refraction effect would use.
3. **Composer** — scene → refraction warp → bloom → tone map (ACES) → grade.

The grade pass folds chromatic aberration, lift/gain/contrast/saturation/temperature, vignette,
film grain and the impact flash into one resample.

Shadows come from a single directional light whose orthographic shadow camera is re-centred on the
character each frame and fitted to a 52 m box at 4096² (~1.3 cm/texel). The `three/addons` CSM
module was tried first and removed: it replaces three's `lights_fragment_begin` chunk *globally*,
so any material not explicitly registered with it silently loses all directional lighting.

Contact shadows are a real render: the character's depth is captured from below into a 256²
target, blurred twice and projected onto the ground.

## Editor and presets

Press **G** for the panel. Folders: Presets, Global, Aim indicator, Frost Lance, Storm Lance,
Cinder Fall, Nova Beam, Environment, Post processing, Camera, Character. Every folder starts
collapsed — there are enough controls here that one open section pushes the rest off the screen.

- **Global** multipliers scale everything at once (speed, glow, noise, particles, lights, impact
  intensity, camera shake, time scale…).
- **Aim indicator** — the arrow's silhouette in metres, its outline and fill, the chevrons and
  frost, and the rings and rosette.
- **Frost Lance** (113 controls, 25 of them colours) — the cast, the footprint, the silhouette,
  the crystal itself, the eruption timing, the ice material, the frost on the ground,
  mist/chips/glitter, the impact and the dynamic light.
- **Storm Lance** (123 controls, 34 of them colours) — the cast, where the bolt leaves the hand,
  the bundle, one filament, the ribbon, flicker and restrike, the bolt's colour, the burns on the
  ground, sparks/motes/smoke/debris, the muzzle and impact, and the dynamic light.
- **Nova Beam** (176 controls) — the cast, where it leaves the hands, the column, the core/sheath/
  halo stack, the surface and its flow, the beam's colour, the coils, the shock discs, the charge
  and its intake, what the floor does, sparks/motes/steam/debris, release/impact/burn, and the two
  dynamic lights.
- **Presets** save to `localStorage`, and can be duplicated, deleted, exported to JSON, imported
  from JSON, or reset to the shipped defaults.

Every ability exposes **every** colour it draws with, and none is derived from another: the crystal
palette, the bolt palette, the beam's four layers and its coils and discs, the ground marks, the
impact shells, the shockwave rings, the screen flashes, and a four-stop lifetime gradient
(`birth → early → late → death`) for each particle system. Tinting the fog without touching the ice,
or cooling the sparks to orange while the filaments stay blue, is a picker away.

Presets are plain snapshots of the settings tree, so an exported file is readable and editable by
hand.

Knobs worth knowing about, because they reshape their ability the most:

- `ice.heightCurve` — how late the ramp climbs; raise it and the field stays low until it explodes
  at the target. `ice.frontBias` below 1 crowds the crystals toward the impact point.
- `thunder.jitter` and `thunder.jitterScale` — how violently the bolt kinks, and how often.
  `thunder.strands` and `thunder.spread` set how wide the bundle reads, and `thunder.restrike`
  how hard it strobes. Those five carry the character of the effect.
- `beam.radius` and `beam.flare` — how heavy the column reads and how hard it opens out where it
  lands. `beam.charge` and `beam.lifetime` are the wind-up and the hold, which are what make this
  ability feel unlike the other three, and `beam.coreWidth` / `beam.coreFill` decide whether the
  layers stay separable or blow out to white.

---

## Performance notes

- Abilities, decals, bursts and particles are pooled, per type. Twelve casts in a row build at most
  **four** instances of an ability and then stop allocating.
- The whole crystal field is three draw calls regardless of crystal count; the cap is 288.
- A whole bolt is **two** draw calls regardless of filament count; the cap is 24 filaments at 72
  samples each. Nothing about the path touches the CPU, so `strands` is nearly free.
- A whole beam is **six** draw calls regardless of how many coils and discs are on it — three tube
  passes over one shared geometry, plus one instanced draw each for the coils, the discs and the
  charge orb. As with the bolt, none of the shape touches the CPU, so `coils` and `rings` are
  nearly free. It takes two of the six dynamic lights (the column and the caster's hands), so four
  concurrent beams would exhaust the pool; `LightPool.acquire()` returns null and every use of the
  handle is guarded.
- The six dynamic point lights are created at boot and parked at zero intensity rather than added
  and removed — changing the light count forces three to recompile every material.
- Shadow maps update exactly once per frame even though the scene is rendered several times.
- `renderer.compileAsync()` runs during boot so the first cast never stutters on shader compile.
- Pixel ratio is capped at 1.75; the depth and distortion buffers are half resolution.

Measured on a default cast: 32 draw calls idle, ~69 with a full ice field standing and ~49 with a
bolt in the air, ~1150 live particles. All four abilities cast at once peaks at ~186 draw calls and
five of the six dynamic lights.

Live counters (FPS, live particles, instances, draw calls) are in the top-right of the HUD.

## The archive

`src/archive/` holds the previous incarnation of this project: a four-element bending sandbox
(fire, water, earth, air) cast along a freehand-drawn spline, plus a walk mode that let the avatar
ride the same stroke. None of it is imported by the live app, so Vite never bundles it.

It was retired because this build replaced path drawing with a linear skillshot, which removed the
input every one of those systems was built on. The raymarched flame and water surfaces in
particular are worth mining. See `src/archive/README.md` for what is in there and how to restore a
piece of it.

---

## Known rough edges

- Crystals are drawn with `transparent: true` and `depthWrite: true`. That is the right trade for
  near-opaque ice and it keeps the field from sorting through itself, but at low `ice.opacity` the
  sorting artefacts between overlapping spikes become visible.
- The eruption front is a straight line on a flat floor. Both assumptions are baked in — the ground
  is a single plane at y = 0, and the aim raycast targets that plane.
- The distortion pass runs with nothing writing to it. It costs a half-res clear per frame.
- The impact cluster is placed radially around the end point, so at very short cast distances it
  can overlap the band behind it more than it should.
